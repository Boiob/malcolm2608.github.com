title: My progress on learning Ruby/Rails
---


Since I decided I want to learn how to create a dynamic website I have been reading small books about ruby. For me however,  I have to use what I know or else reading and watching videos will be useless . When I first started learning python I enjoyed playing around with GUI toolkits in order to get a better grasp of the language. For ruby I decided to use [shoes](http://shoesrb.com/), it is not for very large or complex programs but it was exactly what I needed and now I think I'm ready to learn how to use rails .
