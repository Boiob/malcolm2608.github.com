###A new begining
Since my last post I have gotten a job at a local walmart and been promoted twice to a department manager.
The good thing about this promotion is that I can actually have solid days off to go back to learning 
things and playing video games. So this week I decided to learn angular and use it to re-create this blog as a single paged website all without having a server-side framework, for now.

####Future Website Goals:

* A single paged interface.
* Cleaner code
* Better Styling
* More animations
