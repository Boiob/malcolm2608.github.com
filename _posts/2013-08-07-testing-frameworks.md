I made a decision on how I'm going to pick a server side scripting language , after watch videos and reading articles comparing a few of them i have narrowed it down to either php , python (frameworks), or ruby (frameworks). I took a look at some node.js and the express framework written for it but that seems to be way over my head , so I'll just try each one of them in this order:

- Ruby with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- Python with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Php ](http://www.php.net/) 

It is also possible that I'll try asp.net however I am not that great with C# and I'd like to be able to use a linux server as a host and I don't think you can do that with asp.net using the .net framework .
