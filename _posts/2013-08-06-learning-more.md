title: Learning more and improving

I am really happy with the way my blog turned out and the feed back from reddit boosted my confidence on my efforts. Now I plan to make this website look better and more interesting while developing my skills and to learn server side scripting codecadameny didn't really help me to much with php . I hope the nice people at [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1jsqdh/ruby_vs_python_vs_php_for_server_side_scripting/) can help me pick a server side scripting language to go with and some resources on that language.
