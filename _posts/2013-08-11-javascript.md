title: I don't like javascript very much
---

Every since I finished the javascript lessons on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) I have had a general dislike for javascript. I might might have something to do with python and java being my first two languages , but java script looks ugly and hard to read for me . Even though I can use it and the Jquery framework pretty well, I would much rather look up an alternative like [coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) that compiles down to generated javascript . The propblem is that javascript is **THE** language to use for broswer side scripting , and as far as i know everything else would need to be compiled down to javascript. Unless its possible to download an extention on your browser that would allow you to run coffescript or other javascript alternatives natively . However, its not every likely that the average person browsing the internet doesn't want to download something for a website to work correctly.

but what do I know
